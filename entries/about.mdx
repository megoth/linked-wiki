# About

It's basically a static site generator that builds HTML enriched with semantics using RDFa and some linked data
resources for you. It also extends MDX by the use of some local rehype plugins, to add some bits "under the hood",
such as:

- Automatic ids for all elements of interest (titles, paragraphs, quotes, etc)
- RDFa-related attributes

## Team

The Linked Wiki is an experimental project by [Arne Hassel](https://icanhasweb.net/).
